## ‚ùî About the vulnerability

Apache Log4j, versions 2.0-2.14.1 have a vulnerability to remote code execution (RCE). It is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., attackers may exploit it over a network without the need for a username and password.

2.15.0 aimed to fix the vulnerability but left JNDI lookups enabled by default. 2.16.0 removes the remote lookup parts entirely, explained in [this blog post from Lunasec](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-update-on-cve-2021-45046/).

### üì¶ Software updates

Upgrade log4j to the latest 2.16.0 release to fix the vulnerability. 

- [log4j 2.16.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0) removes support for message lookups, and disables JNDI by default. 
- [log4j 2.15.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0) fixes the vulnerability in `CVE-2021-44228`

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigating the vulnerability

The best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to update any application using Log4j to version 2.15.0+.  However, there have been many other discussions of how to mitigate the vulnerability short of that.

- Disable message lookups.  These are availabe in Log4j 2.10 - 2.14.1 and requires restarting the process.
  - Adding `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to processes running Log4j 2.10 - 2.14.1.  
  - Setting an environmental variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`
- For versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.10.0, you could remove the JndiLookup class by running the code below and restarting the process
  - `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
- Without restarting the process, you could apply this [hot patch](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) which injects a Java agent into running processes to patch the issue.
